# Exhaustive licensing information for files in the Godot Bluetooth Module repository
# =========================================================================
#
# This file aims at documenting the copyright and license for every source
# file in the Godot Bluetooth Module repository, and especially outline the files
# whose license differs from the MIT/Expat license used by Godot Bluetooth Module.
#
# It is written as a machine-readable format following the debian/copyright
# specification. Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect
# all corresponding files (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those
# with a more explicit copyright statement.
#
# Licenses are given with their debian/copyright short name (or SPDX identifier
# if no standard short name exists) and are all included in plain text at the
# end of this file (in alphabetical order).
